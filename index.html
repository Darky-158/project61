        <h1> My favourite hobby </h1>
        <h2> Listening to music</h2>
        <section id="bio">
            <p>I like listening to music because it's fun and it can translate to a lot of feelings, like when you'r happy or excited EDM music can tanslate to how you'r feeling pretty well. Some times when you need to feel calm some meditation music can help in doing so a lot.It's just fun to do nothing and just relax and listen to music, it might not sound fun but it is, but hey, you might have a different perspective about it and I'm just telling you mine because maybe you don't like music at all or you may like to jog or run or walk while listening to it.v

        <p>Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for the singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out".

            The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013.

            The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.[1][2]

            The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States.[3] Twenty One Pilots also became the third rock act to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.[4]</p>
